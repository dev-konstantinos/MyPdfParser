# PDF File Analyzer

This is a simple console application to parse and analyze PDF files. It uses the [UglyToad.PdfPig](https://github.com/UglyToad/PdfPig) library for PDF text extraction.

## Features

- Reads a PDF file specified by the user.
- Extracts words, cleans punctuation, and normalizes text.
- Counts the frequency of each word (case-insensitive).
- Displays a sorted frequency list in the console.
- Interactive console menu with options to analyze a PDF or exit.

## Current Status

This is an initial version focused on basic word frequency analysis. The architecture allows easy extension for future features.

## Planned Improvements

- Export frequency reports to a file.
- Advanced text analytics (e.g., phrase detection, stop-word filtering).
- Improved error handling and logging.
- GUI or web interface.
